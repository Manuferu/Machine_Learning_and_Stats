In this project, it is contained two jupyer notebooks:

## scikit-learn.ipynb:

The aim of this notebook is to go through the scikit-learn by seeing an overview of the library and trying three different algorithms. The idea is to show how to code those algorithms, our propouse was far to be give an accurate analysis.

within the first section, one of the build in datasets (called wine dataset [1]) has been used for demonstrations. This dataset has the advantage that has been split already in data and target, making the clean up part much more straightforward.

In the second part, it has been picked an external dataset from Forest Observation Systems [2]. The dataset is presented in tabular format (csv). It contains sample information about several variables such wood density, above ground carbon, altitude, forest status and much more. 

**since it was possible to access the dataset from the link directly**, it is not incorporated within the github directory. 

The three algorithms demonstrated are : **LiniarRegression**, **Support Vector Machine**, **MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier**
